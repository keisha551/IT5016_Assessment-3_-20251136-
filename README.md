Folder context 
- class_practicals: Inside this folder is a few of the python files I learnt from my lecturer to help with doing my own codes
- own_code: Inside this folder is a few of python files that I have coded for assignments



Assessment overview 


In my repository I need to have my own codes and codes practiced with comments analyzing programming principles and concepts 


Summary of comments and analysis in this projects 
- the key software design principles mentioned in the codes are SRP(single responsibility principle) stating that in a class,method and function it should only have one task to focus on
- modularity is the practice for breaking down the code in components creating an organized code
- abstraction hides the complex process focusing on making the code clearer and easy to understand and reuse
- encapsulation is covering the data by grouping them and actions into a class to accessable to use
