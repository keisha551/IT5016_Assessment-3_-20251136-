Assessment 3: Programming Principles and Concepts

Folder context 
- class_practicals: Inside this folder is a few of the python files I learnt from my lecturer to help with doing my own codes
- own_code: Inside this folder is a few of python files that I have coded for assignments



Assessment overview 


In my repository I need to have my own codes and codes practiced with comments analyzing programming principles and concepts 


Summary of comments and analysis in this projects 
- the key software design principles mentioned in the codes are SRP(single responsibility principle) stating that in a class,method and function it should only have one task to focus on
- modularity is the practice for breaking down the code in components creating an organized code
- abstraction hides the complex process focusing on making the code clearer and easy to understand and reuse
- encapsulation is covering the data by grouping them and actions into a class to accessable to use



How the software design principles are demonstrated in code 
- SRP is demonstrated in the software project code where functions focus on one task in staff_info focus on the input functions and the requisition approval focus only on the calculation process whether approved or pending and the display_requsitions focus only on printing the output to user
- modularity is demonstrated in the python functions when defining each function is broken down into sepearte components making it easy to test and run the code
- abstraction is demonstrated in the park meter simulation code for calculating the parking time countdown when using the while loop function to hide the complex calculation this can create a clean function and easy for user interaction
- encapsulation is demonstrated in the python functions the data from the staff_info is returned in the dict storing the private information in the function



To understand the thought process and research findings 


In the folder class_practicals the codes are what I learnt in class and how it could help when writing my own codes for projects and assignments when following the codes I was able to put into practice with different scenarios given helping me when deciding the design principles to understand the importance of maintaing the code to be up to date and no errors to be reusable for other projects saving time when creating the code
